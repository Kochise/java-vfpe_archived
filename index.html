<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
The purported advantages of Visual Programming, as applied to general-purpose 
programming languages, have remained largely unfulfilled.  The 
essence of this thesis is that functional programming languages have at 
least one natural visual representation, and that a useful programming 
environment can be based upon this representation.
<p>
This thesis describes the implementation of a Visual Functional
Programming Environment (VFPE). The programming environment has several
significant features. 
<ul> 
<li> The environment includes a program
editor that is inherently visual and interactive: syntactic program
components have a visual representation and are assembled via a
graphical interface. 
<li> The program editor incorporates a static
analysis system that tracks types for the whole program, making it
impossible to construct syntactically incorrect or type-incorrect
programs. Type information is continually and explicitly available to
the programmer. 
<li>The environment implements an implicitly typed
higher-order purely functional language without conforming exactly to
any particular language with respect to syntactic structures or
reduction semantics. 
<li>Programs can be output as source code for an
existing functional language. 
<li>The visual representation allows
for continued experimentation with new syntactic features. Some
currently included features are algebraic data types, pattern matching,
and guarded expressions. 
<li>The environment includes a visual
interpreter which allows any expression to be reduced in source form,
with a choice of reduction behaviors. 
</ul>

Despite my struggle of many years against the encroaching
tide of software bloat, I have somehow made some
unknown modification which means it's broken under
Java 1.1 .  Unless you have Java 1.3 installed, you'd better 
use a "with Java" installer.

<p>
These applets were intended to run off a CD.  They load many
large images which will cause delays over a slow network
connection.  Here is a zip archive containing all the 
<a href="movies.zip">applets</a> (around 3 Mb).

Note that these slideshows contain large images, so it is suggested
that you maximise your browser window while viewing.  Unlike the
applets, these slideshows do not show the program after every
operation.  <a href="slides.zip">Here</a> is a zip archive with
