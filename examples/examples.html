<font size=4>Example Programs</font>
<p>
To view the example programs:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Start the VFPE application.
<li> Press the "load from file" pallet button (the picture of a folder).
<li> Browse to the CD "examples" folder.
<li> Select a ".sfe" (serialised functional expression) file and
press the "open" button.  This will pick up the selected program.
<li> Drop the program onto the placeholder at the top of the
editor "Main Expression" panel.
</ol>

<p>

<font size=3 face=courier>Sorting.sfe</font> contains functional implementations of 
three classic sorting algorithms. 

<p>

<font size=3 face=courier>ParserCombinators.sfe</font> contains a set of parser combinators:
higher-order functions for building parsers. These functions look quite
elegant, with the symmetries between, say, the sequencer and alternater
combinators being clearly visible. The visual version of this program
differs from the textual version: in the visual version it is clearer to
omit the intermediate named expressions, which exist only to avoid very
long lines of text.

<p>

<font size=3 face=courier>Datum.sfe</font> is a data type and parser for LISP-like
expressions. The parser is constructed from the parser combinators. This
program makes heavy use of partially-applied functions.

<p>

<font size=3 face=courier>Dict.sfe</font> is a
balanced binary tree (red-black tree) implementation of a finite map
type. A by-product of using tree layout of functional programs is a
particular clarity in the expression of algorithms that operate of
tree-structured data. An example of this is in the tree-balancing
functions in the red-black tree implementation. The algorithm most
clearly described with tree diagrams. The translation
into procedural code usually involves complicated nested conditionals.
Functional implementations that make use of pattern-matching are much
clearer, and the VFPE implementation is slightly
clearer again (actually looking like the original diagrams).
