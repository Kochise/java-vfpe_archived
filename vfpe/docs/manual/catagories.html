<h2>Visual Syntax (under construction)</h2>
<br><em>see chapter 3 of thesis</em><br>
Individual nodes, representing parts of the functional program's abstract
syntax tree, fall into various catagories.  Broadly speaking, these are:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Values</b>.  Appear as rectangular syntax nodes.  Can be grabbed and
dropped.  All have cut, copy and evaluation operations.

<li><b>Bindings</b>.  Appear as syntax nodes with rounded ends.  Are always
associated with some abstration value node.  All have rename operations, and
can be clicked on to created a named variable.
