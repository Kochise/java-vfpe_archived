<h2>"How Do I ..."</h2>
<p>
This page describes how to perform a number of common programming
operations.
<p>
<b>How do I load an expression ?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Click the "load" button on the pallet.
<li>Drop the expression where needed (onto the placeholder of the prelude
node for an entire program).
</ol>
<p>
<b>How do I save an expression ?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Open the control panel of the root node of the expression to be
saved.  Click the "copy" button to grab a copy of the expression.
<li>Drop the expression into the "save" control on the pallet.  Note
that only expressions with no free variables can be saved.
</ol>
<p>
<b>How do I write a Haskell code fragment ?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Open the control panel of the root node of the "let" expression to be
saved.  Click the "copy" button to grab a copy of the expression.
<li>Drop the expression into the "write Haskell" control on the pallet.
The bindings of the let expression become top-level Haskell definitions in a
text file.
</ol>
<p>
<b>How do introduce a local definition at some point ?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Grab a let expression from the pallet.
<li>Drop the expression onto the root node of the expression where the
definitions are needed.
</ol>
<p>
<b>How do I introduce a constructor pattern (eg "(x : xs)" for non-empty
list) ?</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Grab an instance of the constructor function from the pallet.
<li>Drop the expression onto the variable pattern being updated (variables
can be renamed from the default values using the binding's control panel).
</ol>
