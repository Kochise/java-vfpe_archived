<h2>Tutorial 1: Editor</h2>

<p>
This tutorial assumes that the user is familiar with functional programming in
gerneral, but not with the VPFE system.
<p>

<h3>Construction of the "map" function.</h3>

This brief tutorial is a step-by-step guide through the definition of the "map"
function.  The example shows the VPFE facilities for higher-order functions, 
recursion and pattern-matching.  In Haskell, the function we will define can be
expressed as: <br>
<pre>
    myMap f []     = []
    myMap f (x:xs) = (f x) : (myMap f xs)
</pre>
<p>


<h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>

During the contruction process, we suggest that that you make use of the "tool-tip"
information capability to look at the types of various nodes.  If the pointer is left to
linger over a node for a few seconds, a label should pop up near the node, showing the
currently inferred type of the node and into which syntactic catagory it falls.  For
further information on the various syntactic catagories, see <a href="../catagories.html">
here</a>.

<ul>

<li>
Over on the right of the VFPE window is the <em>pallet</em> panel.  Part of the panel
is dedicated to <em>source</em> buttons, which are used to create new functional 
subexpressions.  In order to create the map function, we need to create a definition 
context in which the name "myMap" will be bound to the value of the map function.  
Click (with the left button on a multiple button mouse) on the <b>Let</b> button on the
sources panel.
<br>
Note that the cursor changes to indicate the fact that a subexpression has been
<em>grabbed</em>.  The "info" panel at the top of the pallet will also show the grabbed
expression.

<li>
On the left of the VFPE window is the main expression panel.  It contains
a view of the top-level of the program being edited.  
<br>
In any visual function expression, the question mark nodes represent parts of 
the program that are undefined ie that have yet to be built.  Underneith the 
<b>prelude</b> node (which represents all the built-in and primitive function 
definitions) is a placeholder node: this is the starting state of an empty visual 
functional program, which is completely undefined.
<br>
The main program construction operation consists of defining part of an undefined
program.  This is achived by <em>dropping</em> a grabbed subexpression onto a placeholder
node.  To perform the drop, click on the placeholder node to add the <b>Let</b> 
expression to the program.

<br>

<li>
We now have an empty list of definitions, to which we can add our own function
bindings.  We want to add a binding for the myMap function, so click on the "plus"
button on the Let node.
<br>
In the text field of the dialog that pops up, type "myMap f xs" in order to name
the function and its arguments.  Check the "make pattern set" check box (since we
want to make a function defintion with a set of pattern-matching equations), then
click "OK".

<p><center>
<img src="tute3.gif"><br>

</center><br>

<li>
Right click (or control-click) on the "mapMap" label that now appears in the Let
node.  This will open a window containing the definition of the myMap function.  
In general, left-clicking will pick up or drop a subexpression, while right-clicking
will reveal information about a node.

<p><center>

</center><br>

<li>
We now will construct the first equation of the function definition.  We need to
build a pattern (the equation's "left hand side") that will match the empty list.  
On the sources pallet, click on the "data" primitive button from the middle column 
of buttons.  This will show the group of built in functions related to data items.  
Pick up a empty list node (the "Nil" button).

<p><center>

</center><br>

<br>
Under the <b>Patterns</b> node in the myMap definition window should be three nodes.  The
left two are binding nodes representing the formal parameters.  Drop the <b>Nil</b>
subexpression onto the "xs".  This converts the variable pattern to a constructor
pattern.

<li>
We now need to make the body of the first equation (the "right hand side").  Grab
a <b>Nil</b> subexpression (in the same way as the previous step) and drop it onto the
placeholder underneith the <b>Patterns</b> node.  We have now completed the first 
equation, defining the map of the empty list to be the empty list.

<p><center>
<img src="tute6.gif"><br>
The first pattern completed.
</center><br>

<li>
We now need to add a second pattern (or equation) to the definition.  To do this we
need to make use of the <em>subexpression control panel</em>.  Right click (or
control-click) on the <b>Patterns</b> node.  Right-clicking on any node will bring up 
a control panel with controls and information specific to the sort of node selected.
In this case we wish to add a new pattern, so click on the "add pattern after" button.
At the dialog that prompts for variable names, type "f xs" and press return (or click
the OK button).

<p><center>

<br>
To display the new pattern, click on the right-pointing arrow button on the <b>Pattern</b>
node.  For node types that display one of a set of alternative subexpressions as
part of their layout (such as patterns, guarded expressions and lists), the right and
left arrows on the node face step up and down through the alternatives.

<li>
Next we want to make a pattern that will match a list with at least one element, and
bind names to the head and tail of that list.  Grab a "Cons" subexpression from the
data source panel, and drop it onto the "xs" variable.  Note that in the names bound
to the head and tail are given default values ("x" and "xs" in this case).  It is
possible to globally rename variables using the binding node's control panel (since
the VPFE does not use the textual name of the variable to identify it, the renaming
will not result an any name clashes).

<p><center>

<li>
We need to contruct the body (right hand side) of the second equation.  The root of this
expression is a list constructed with the "Cons" data constructor.  Grab a "Cons"
node from the data source panel, and drop it onto the placeholder.  

<li>
As the head of the result list, we need to apply the function argument "f" to the
head of the list argument "(x : xs)".  Pick up an <b>Apply</b> node by clicking
on the apply button on the sources panel.  This will prompt for the number of 
arguments to apply: choose "1".  Drop the <b>Apply</b> node onto the left-hand
placeholder child of the <b>Cons</b> node.  The new <b>Apply</b> node will have
two placeholders of its own, one for the function being applied and one for the
argument.

<p><center>

</center><br>

<li>
Click on the "f" variable binding node.  This will create and grab a variable for
the "f" binding.  Drop the variable into the left placeholder of the <b>Apply</b>
node.

<li>
Similarly, grab a "x" variable by clicking on the "x" binding node.  Drop the variable
into the right placeholder of the <b>Apply</b> node.

<li>
We can neaten this up by hiding the <b>Apply</b> node.  Bring up the control panel
for the node (by right-clicking on it), and check the "hide apply" checkbox.

<li>
Next, we need to made the tail of the result list (this part contains the recursive
call).  Grab an application of the "myMap" function by clicking on the "myMap" binding 
node, which appears at the very top of the window.  Drop it onto the remaining
placeholder.  At the point, enough of the function has been defined to determine that
it has two arguments, so the <b>myMap</b> node has two placeholder children.

<li>
The next bit is a little tricky.  We need to put a an "f" variable into the left-hand
placeholder of the <b>myMap</b> node.  Doing the obvious thing ie grabbing an "f" 
variable and dropping it in will produce and error: we suggest you do it anyway for
educational purposes.  You should see a type-checking failure message in the message
area at the bottom of the editor window (which is unfortunately not very informative
at this time).  <a href="footnote1.html">Here's</a> an explanation (that can safely
be ignored for now).
<br>
If you grabbed an "f" variable, get rid of it by dropping it in the "rubbish bin"
button on the <em>sinks</em> panel.
<br>
Un-check the "apply variables" checkbox on the <em>info</em> panel on the pallet.
Now grab an "f" variable and drop it into the left-hand placeholder (this should
now work).  Check the "apply variables" checkbox and continue with the construction.

<li>
Finally, grab an "xs" variable, and drop it into the remaining placeholder.  The
function definition is now complete.

<li>
We could now save the program.  To do this bring up the control panel for the 
<b>Let</b> node in the main VFPE window.  Click on the "copy" button.  This will
grab a copy of the expression (in this case the expression is rooted at the "Let"
value, which contains the whole program).  Drop this onto the "save" button on the
<em>sinks</em> on the pallet.  This will bring up a standard file-save dialog (we
tend to save expressions as files with an ".sfe" extension, for "serialised functional
expression").
