The problem is that grabbing a variable (either by clicking on a built-in function on
the source panel or by clicking on a binding node) will actually create a <em>
function application</em> if the variable has a function-valued type.  When we clicked
on "f" the first time (to make the head of the result list), the editor knew nothing
about the type of "f", so the variable created was a bare value, not an application
of the "f" function.  Now that the editor knows that "f" is a function, grabbing an
"f" variable actually creates a function application, which won't fit the type of
the placeholder (which is expecting a function type).  The editor behaves in this
way because in the majority of cases we actually want to build function applications:
only in a few cases, such as when we are dealing with higher-order functions, do
we need to override this behaviour.
