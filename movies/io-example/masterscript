"Using the Haskell monad 'do' syntax program can be
written:

    main = do
        putStr \"What is your name ? \"
	name <- getLine
        putStr (\"Hello \" ++ name)
")
(wait)

(change-comment
"Without the monad syntax this would be a little more
complicated:

    main =
        putStr \"What is your name ? \" >>
	getLine >>= (\name -> 
	putStr (\"Hello \" ++ name))
"

"The VFPE does not have the 'do' syntax but as we shall see
the tree layout goes a long way toward making the structure
of the monad expression clear."

"We begin by making a LET binding that will form the top
level of our Haskell program.  We add a 'main' binding that
will be the program's entry point."
